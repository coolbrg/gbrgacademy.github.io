           para="My theory of Learn-Teach Cycle has reached to a level where I think I should open an Academy so that I could engage myself at larger level. And, then another chapter in my life begins."

<br/>

I always feel that I had that spark within for _Teaching_. I even tested that spark by teaching few occasions whenever I got chance throughout the life I had so far. I think it's time to push further and test this spark at larger level.

# About

<span style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">GbrG Academy</span> is or will be going to spread Education which has 
been acquired completely out of _Real World Experiences_ apart from the _Bookish Knowledge_ as we believe some of the 
experiences couldn't be expressed through Book. We would try to adapt the _Cognitive(Pragmatic)_ and/or _Feedback 
Driven Learning_ approaches and try our level best to make both learning and teaching experience __fun__ and __effective__.

# Origin

{% include blogs/quote.html 
           quote="The greatest enemy of Knowledge is not Ignorance, it is the illusion of Knowledge."
           quote_by="Stephen Hawking"
%}

I somehow agree with above quote which relates _Ignorance_ and _Illusion_ with _Knowledge_. Although, I am unsure that
I have completely understood the context and message the author wanted to convey here, I am slightly touched _within_ 
by the quote which intrigued me to explore it further.
<br><br>
Throughout my professional career, which spans around seven and half plus years till date, I had gone enrolled myself to many online courses, could complete few, sometimes even enrolled twice for few but couldn't go beyond two weeks of it's syllabus and in a worst case, I even couldn't started few post enrollment.

{% include blogs/quote.html 
           quote="I think I ignored the Knowledge I could get from the Course and/or got Illusioned that I had gained <b>Complete</b> knolwedge about the course."
%}

When I tried to decode the reason behind it, I could found two and later includes my long-time _Partner in Crime_:

{% include blogs/quote.html 
           quote="1. Lack of Motivation to Complete<br>2. Over-confidence post Completion"
           quote_with_bar=true
%}

##### I think we can only guide how one could succeed on the second reason but we can definitely motivate.

And, I believe that the _Teaching-Learning_ should be a _Fun Experience_ for both teacher as well as student.

# Mission

We understand that there is _a Gap_ exists due to either _No_ or _Improper Education_. 
<br>
Our mission is to 

{% include blogs/quote.html 
           quote="Bridge the Gap that exists now and has been created over a period of time."
%}

Though _Hard Work_ is the essential element to _Succeed_, we believe following are equally responsible.

{% include blogs/quote.html 
           quote="1. Right Attitude<br>2. Balanced Disipline<br>3. Extraordinary Determination<br>4. Positive Approach"
           quote_with_bar=true
%}

# Vision

With proper education, one could help self as well as society and ultimately country.
<br>
We hope to guide you to

{% include blogs/quote.html 
           quote="Acquire the appropriate Knowledge which should help you to choose Right Career in Life."
%}

Finally, we always strive to our best to bring _an Educational Environment_ within _You, Society & Nation_.
